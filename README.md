# This is the paxxous kahoot pin finder.

Pretty self explanatory. Though it doesn't work for me, I'm trying to find out why that is.    it seems that Kahoot has some protection against this, I guess making so many requests kind of alerts Kahoot a bit.

I'll try and teak everything so that it turns out well. But for now, mess around with it and make a pull request if you find a solution.
